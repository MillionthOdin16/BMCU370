- Contactless magnetic sensing
- I2C interface (address 0x36)
- 3.3V or 5V operation
- Response time: <1ms

**Installation**:
- Mount sensor PCB near rotating magnet
- Magnet should be diametrically magnetized
- 0.5-3mm air gap recommended
- Ensure magnet is centered over sensor
- **CRITICAL: Magnet polarity orientation must be consistent across all channels**
  - Install all magnets with the same pole (North or South) facing the sensor
  - Inconsistent magnet polarity will cause motor direction detection errors
  - Mark magnets during assembly to ensure consistent orientation

### Pressure Sensors

**Purpose**: Filament insertion/removal detection

**Type**: Analog pressure sensors or micro-switches
**Interface**: ADC input (0-3.3V)
**Thresholds**:
- High pressure (filament inserted): >1.85V
- Low pressure (filament removed): <1.45V
- Hysteresis prevents false triggering

### RGB LEDs (NeoPixel Compatible)

**Purpose**: Visual status indication

**Specifications**:
- WS2812B or compatible addressable RGB LEDs
- 5V power supply required
- Data transmission: 800kHz
- 24-bit color depth (8 bits per channel)

**LED Configuration**:
- 2 LEDs per filament channel (configurable)
- 1 LED for main board status
- Total: 9 LEDs default configuration

## Power Requirements

### Supply Voltage
- **MCU Core**: 3.3V (internal regulator from 5V)
- **RGB LEDs**: 5V (high current capability required)
- **Sensors**: 3.3V (provided by MCU regulator)
- **Motors**: Variable (typically 12V-24V)

### Current Consumption
- **MCU**: ~50mA @ 144MHz
- **RGB LEDs**: ~20mA per LED per color channel (max 60mA per LED)
- **Sensors**: ~10mA total for all AS5600 sensors
- **Motors**: Variable depending on load

### Power Supply Recommendations
- **5V Rail**: Minimum 2A capacity for RGB LEDs
- **Motor Supply**: Appropriate for stepper motors (typically 1-2A per channel)
- **Clean Power**: Use bypass capacitors near MCU and sensors

## PCB Layout Considerations

### Signal Integrity
- Keep crystal oscillator traces short
- Use ground plane under high-speed digital signals
- Separate analog and digital ground sections

### Power Distribution
- Dedicate wide traces for power rails
- Place bypass capacitors close to IC power pins
- Use appropriate trace width for current capacity

### EMI/EMC
- Keep switching circuits away from analog sensors
- Use ferrite beads on motor power lines if needed
- Shield sensitive analog circuits

## Mechanical Mounting

### AS5600 Sensor Mounting
- Sensors must be precisely aligned with rotating magnets
- Use mounting brackets to maintain consistent air gap
- Protect sensors from contamination and physical damage
- **Ensure consistent magnet polarity orientation across all channels**

### Magnet Assembly Guidelines
**Critical for Motor Direction Detection:**

1. **Polarity Marking**: Mark all magnets during manufacturing to indicate pole orientation
2. **Consistent Installation**: Install all magnets with the same pole (North or South) facing the AS5600 sensor
3. **Verification Procedure**: Use a compass or magnetic field detector to verify polarity before final assembly
4. **Quality Control**: Include magnet polarity check in assembly verification steps

**Magnet Specifications:**
- Diametrically magnetized (not axially magnetized)
- Neodymium N35 or stronger recommended  
- Diameter appropriate for gear assembly
- Thickness 2-4mm for optimal field strength

**Assembly Notes:**
- Random magnet orientation will cause motor direction detection errors
- Inconsistent polarity is a primary cause of channels 1, 2, and 3 direction reversal
- Proper magnet installation reduces need for software direction corrections

### LED Placement
- Channel LEDs should be visible from front panel
- Main board LED indicates overall system status
- Consider light diffusion for even illumination

### Heat Management
